# pandas-challenge
I had to go back and look at quite a number of different 'more complex' examples of different dataframe, groupby, filtering and data cleaning examples in Pandas in order to supplement what we learned in the class material for this challenge.  I also got some assistance from one of our class TAs and bounced questions off of a couple of fellow classmates.  I used the starter code provided with the homework download in order to follow the preferred formatting.  Here are a few of the links I referenced when I was working on my code.

I used this to help me when calculating the total number of students passing math and reading, as well as the percentages of students passing

I found this helpful when doing a number of the groupby solutions - specifically for method chaining

When I first went to create the dataframes which presented the student performance results by school size, by school spend and by school type - I kept running into a value error which I figured had something to do with the data type of the values in one of the columns.  A fellow student pointed me to this stackoverflow thread about changing formatting.  The examples from our class activities on formatting and data cleaning were also useful here.
