    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- The combined dataset spanned 15 schools with over 39,000 students and a total aggregated budget of almost $25 million.  The below analysis looked at average scores in math and reading as well as average passing rates in those categories (70% or higher).  It looked at these statistics by school, by total budget per student, by school type (district vs charter), by grade (10th grade, 11th grade etc) and finally by school size (measured in total students).  Numerous tables are presented throughout the analysis comparing math and reading performance metrics by these different school criteria.  Across the dataset, overall passing rates were nearly 75% in math, and 85% in reading but just 65% for both categories combined.  Average scores and average passing rates generally did not change much by grade (9th, 10th etc) within agiven school.  Small and medium sized schools (less than 1000 students and 1000-2000 students) fared much better than large schools (>2000 students).  Finally, charter schools fared significantly better than district schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From the analysis, two things really stood out to me.  First, total spending per student (budget per capita) was actually negatively correlated with better student performance, which is opposite to what you might normally expect (i.e. higher per student spending produces better results).  Second, despite much better overall performance - charter schools average budget per student was much smaller than that of most district schools.  It's worth mentioning that all but one of the charter schools fell into either the small or medium-sized categories while every one of the district schools fell into the 'large' category.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on these observations, it would seem that higher spending per student (budget per capita) is not a good predictor of student performance, and if anything could be an indication of school budgets being misspent.  From this dataset, the clearest indicator of strong student performance seems to be school size - the smaller the school the better the students do.  Presumably, this is because smaller schools have smaller classroom size and thus teachers are able to devote more attention to each individual student."
